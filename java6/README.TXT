PROJECT TITLE:  Java Lab-6
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Practise question/Assignment
VERSION or DATE:    16-02-2025
AUTHORS:    23MCCE16
USER INSTRUCTIONS: Please see the images to see to how to give input
		UseBag contain two menu driven 1. for creating bag object and 2. To see operations in bag object.

Observation : 1. we can use rear = new Node(data, rear); -> this will create a new node with data and pointing to rear and then set this to
		rear.
	      2.we can also use rear = front = null;	 

Comparison :-

1.Queue Sll is more memory efficient then array queue because we can dynamically change the size of single link list or add or remove node from the list whereas Queue array size doesn't change after allocating its size.

2.Queue Sll is more flexible more than Queue array because we can add or remove node at the time of insertion and deletion.

3.Queue Sll is less efficient compared to array queue because when we want to go forth position of node we have to traverse through initial three node which is less efficient.

4.Insertion/deletion in queue sll has extra step apart form creating and allocating new node and pointing previous node to it.
